### Files

1. Functional Analysis ("./src/fft_conv_layer_analysis.ipynb")
2. Neural Net Training Analysis ("./src/conv_neural_net_analysis.ipynb")

### How to run the files

We performed the experiments on google colab. 
The code requires the runtime as GPU (since we have used code to run analysis on GPU)

You would likely need to install some python libraries if its missing it your runtime.

Colab Code:
!pip install <library-name>
